# Hi, I'm Syif M. Bhuiyan.
### Data Analyst & Aspiring Researcher in Information Science

I apply data science methods to investigate social and economic systems. I have utilized **Computational Social Science** and **Data Analytics** to investigate algorithmic fairness, digital economics, and information asymmetry.

My goal is to bridge the gap between technical data science and social inquiry, applying methods like **OLS Regression**, **Bias Auditing**, and **Causal Inference** to understand how information systems impact society.

🎯 Open to research collaborations and academic opportunities.

# 👋 Hi, I'm Syif M. Bhuiyan

I’m a data analyst who helps businesses uncover insights and build smarter solutions through data. I specialize in Python, SQL, Excel, Power BI, Tableau, and Google Sheets.

I’ve worked on public dataset projects ranging from automation and database querying to dashboard creation and exploratory data analysis — with the goal of making data easier to understand and act on.

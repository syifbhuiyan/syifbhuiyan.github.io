# About Me

I am a data analyst and prospective graduate researcher focused on **Information Science** and **Human-Centered AI**. My work sits at the intersection of technical data analysis and social ethics—using code not just to optimize business metrics, but to audit systems and uncover sociotechnical dynamics.

### Research Interests
* **Algorithmic Accountability:** Investigating bias in automated decision-making systems (e.g., credit scoring, hiring).
* **Computational Social Science:** Using digital trace data to understand housing markets and urban dynamics.
* **Information Ethics:** Analyzing the "FAccT" (Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency) principles in fintech.

### Technical & Methodological Toolkit
I combine statistical rigor with data engineering skills to handle complex datasets.
* **Languages:** Python (Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Statsmodels, Fairlearn), R, SQL.
* **Methodologies:** Regression Analysis (OLS/Logistic), Hypothesis Testing, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
* **Visualization:** Tableau, Power BI, Matplotlib/Seaborn.

### Education & Continuous Learning
I have built a rigorous foundation in data science through specialized tracks, including:
* **Data Analysis & Literacy** (DataCamp Certifications)
* **Specializations** from University of Michigan & Johns Hopkins (via Coursera)

I am currently seeking a **PhD or research-focused MS** where I can further explore how information systems perpetuate or mitigate social inequalities.

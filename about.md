# About Me

I've completed 9 career tracks and 13 skill tracks from DataCamp, covering Python, R, SQL, Power BI, Tableau, and more. Iâ€™m certified in Data Analysis and Data Literacy.

I enjoy solving real-world problems with data â€” whether it's cleaning messy datasets, building dashboards, or extracting insights that matter.
